		<p class="text">"How can we create the feeling of sifting through a box of old photos when all of the photos are digital?" It's a nostalgic interaction, but by combining it with digital technologies and services such as Instagram we can make it relevant in our digital lives.</p>
		<p class="text">This project is an experiential web application that explores the intersection between the past and the present. It combines nostalgia and data to create a unique way to view your digital content.</p>
		<p class="text">Past &amp; Present was created by <a href="http://owenherterich.com" target="_blank">Owen Herterich</a>, a designer and developer from Texas currently based in New York. While his background is primarily in visual and motion design, he has recently been exploring the realm of code. Heâ€™s interested in creating engaging, thoughtful interactions in both digital and physical spaces.</p>
