		<h3 class="subheading">Process</h3>
		<p class="text">Every day, billions of bytes of content are created, curated, shared, and sent across the networks of the world. Much like ephemera in the real world, their importance is diminished over time on an ever-increasing scale. Soon, they are condemned to an eternal server-side purgatory, existing and available, but forgotten. This ephemeral nature of the Internet is exemplified by this relegation of vast amounts of human cognition and creation to a temporary existence. If we are resigned to acknowledge that life online is fleeting, how can we bring value to some of the data we share? One way to do so is to present such data in a way that allows us to slow down, interact, and consider each piece of content as something created by an individual. The creator of the content spent time to gather his thoughts or carefully compose her picture, but this deliberate creation is lost in the shuffle, one piece of a vast digital puzzle. How can we take this data and view it in a way that allows for more meaningful interaction?</p>
		<p class="text">The notion of artificial ephemerality is an important part of my project. As soon as we create or encounter new content online, the previous data becomes rapidly irrelevant. It’s consumed and forgotten in an instant, its original fleeting purpose served. Unlike a physical note or picture, however, digital information is easily stored and preserved. It is likely that every post that you have made on a social network is still available for viewing, but why bother? Though these posts might have once held importance in your life, they are quickly replaced by what’s newer and more relevant. The content is always available, but its purpose has disappeared. It’s an artificially-imposed ephemerality, something that is a relatively new occurrence in human society.</p>
		<h3 class="subheading">Technology</h3>
		<p class="text">In this project, I want to explore this notion of artificial ephemerality. To do so, I will create a web application that allows users to explore Instagram photos in a carefully designed interface and experience. Instead of the usual flow and grid-like presentation of images, my project will present the content as something that must be explored to be experienced. It is modeled after bins of old photos that you might find in a thrift shop or second-hand store. While digging through old photos, the value lies not in consuming the most amount of information possible, but in uncovering and discovering what might be next. So it is in my project; I want the users to spend time exploring the content of the site through a series on interesting interactions.</p>
		<p class="text">This project is important because it provides a critical look and alternative experience to the standard way of consuming data online. Granted, it is not a project that will appeal to everyone; rather, those who have an interest in how technology is shaping us will be interested in experiencing such a project. By relating digital content to physical and tangible objects, however, I hope to attract a broader audience outside of the tech community. If I am successful in my technical pursuits and the specific invocation of mood and atmosphere, I hope to have people think twice about the alarming pace and nature of their digital lives.</p>
