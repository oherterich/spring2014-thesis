		<h2 class="title">Methodology</h2>
		<h3 class="subheading">Process</h3>
		<p class="text">In this project, users are invited to login to the site with their Instagram account. After doing so, the system grabs their most recent photos and starts the application. The user's photos are shown, along with an additional random selection of curated photos from Instagram. While on the site, users can explore the photos by dragging them around, uncovering what's underneath, and selecting them to find more information. In addition, when multiple users are on the site they are connected via WebSockets. They can see each others' photos and collaboratively explore the space.</p>
		<h3 class="subheading">Technology</h3>
		<p class="text">Past &amp; Present was created with a variety of different technologies. The experience was primarily coded in Javascript with the amazing <a href="http://threejs.org" target="_blank">Three.js</a> library. Most of the server-side code was written in PHP. MySQL databases were used to store information about the photos in the application. <a href="http://nodejs.org/" target="_blank">Node.js</a> and <a href="http://socket.io" target="_blank">Socket.io</a> were also used to handle the multi-user experience on the site.</p>
		<h3 class="subheading">Privacy</h3>
		<p class="text">Upon logging into the site through their Instagram, users' photos are stored on a database in order to link them into the Three.js application. These photos are not shared, distributed, or visible in any capacity (other than on the Past &amp; Present application experience).</p>
